### How do we deliver our promise?
```
For the marketing teams: 
Your webpages meet accessibility standards with following a clear and logical structure so our design and development team can produce the best platform with an extended outreach to your specified customer base, as well as potential customers looking for the right fit. 

For developers:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
